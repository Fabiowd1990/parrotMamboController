#parrotMamboController

I've created this controller when I noticed the Android application to control Parrot Mambo won't work with my phone. 
You can control the Parrot Mambo minidrone with your pc.

#Instructions

To run this software, you need to install golang.
From shell:
    
    go run parrotMambo_minidrone "Mambo_1234"

#Keys

You can change keymap in the file "parrotMamboController.go"
